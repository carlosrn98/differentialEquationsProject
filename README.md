# differentialEquationsProject
This project attempts to solve a differential equations modeling problem and a system of differential equations numerically by using the Runge Kutta 4 method and the shooting method.

For more information about the project, here is the presentation that gave the introduction to the program:

Disclaimer: keep in mind that this project was created a long time ago while at college, so my coding skills and best practices were scarce.
